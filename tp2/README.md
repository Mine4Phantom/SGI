## Project Notes

Our scene is a room with a television, couch, and other elements as seen in the images bellow.
Lighs can be switched on and off through the interface (including the lamp).
Views can only be changed by changing the xml default view. Currently we have two perspective and two ortho views.
We managed to implement all features requested and the parser works with all fields as intended.
Parsing was definitely one of the hardest things done (in terms of dedicated hours).
Overall we believe we achieved all goals required and that we managed to produce a beautifull scene.
