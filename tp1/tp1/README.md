## Project Notes

It is possible to toggle On/Off any of the lights.

Light 3 is the light on the lamp, we decided to make it red so that it is distinct from the others.

We also tried to make the appearance of each object close to reality, as seen by the chairs and tables.

Our main difficulties had to do with the lighting of diferent objects. In particular with the wall which has the door and window, but in the end we managed to divide it into smaller rectangles in order for the lighting on its surface to be uniform.

## Screenshots

### 1 - Overall View

Our Classroom scene is composed of 2 chairs, 3 tables and 1 lamp. One of the walls also has a door and a window.

We think that we managed to do every required task with success as seen by the screenshots below.
